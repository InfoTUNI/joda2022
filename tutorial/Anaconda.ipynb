    "\n",
    "Anaconda is a program to manage (install, upgrade, or uninstall) packages and environments to use with Python or R language. Anaconda makes it simple to install packages and build virtual environments for working on numerous projects at once.\n",
    "\n",
    "It would be beneficial to use Anaconda/Miniconda along side Python since:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Anaconda comes with a number of data science packages, so you'll be ready to work with data right away. \n",
    "2. Managing your packages and environments with ```conda```will reduce future issues with the various libraries you'll be using.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python Packages\n",
    "A package consists of a collection of modules, each of which has a set of classes and function definitions. You can ```import``` and use the functions defined in a package after it has been installed. \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-info\">\n",
    "<b>NOTE</b> When we install Anaconda, it comes with a minimal set of packages pre-installed. However, yoou can install any additional packages if necessary.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Anaconda Distribution\n",
    "Anaconda is a full distribution of Python and comes with over 1,000 open source packages after installation. As a result, the entire file size exceeds 3 GB. If we want to have a lot of packages downloaded and installed, Anaconda is a fantastic choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Anaconda includes the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Anaconda Navigator\n",
    "A graphical user interface that helps open up any installed applications, such as Jupyter notebook or VS code editor. We will learn more about the notebook in the next lesson. See a snapshot of Anaconda Navigator below:\n",

    "### Miniconda\n",
    "Miniconda is a smaller distribution as compared to Anaconda, which includes only ```conda``` and Python. Miniconda can do everything Anaconda is capable of, **but doesn't have the preinstalled packages**. You can still install any of the available packages using ```python conda install PACKAGENAME``` on the terminal/Anaconda Prompt. Interestingly, you can anytime upgrade from Miniconda to Anaconda by using the command:\n",

    "The ```conda``` and ```pip``` both are the Python package managers. Package managers are used to installing libraries and other software on your computer. ```pip``` is the default package manager for Python libraries, whereas ```conda``` focuses only on the packages that are available from the Anaconda distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "> In the newer version of Anaconda/Miniconda, both pip and conda package managers are included by default, so you do not need to install them separately.<br/>\n",
    "> Both ```pip``` and ```conda``` gets installed when you install either Anaconda or Miniconda. ```pip``` also comes preinstalled with Python 3 >=3.4.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Which one should I prefer - pip or conda?\n",
    "There are two points you can consider before making a choice:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The available packages available from the Anaconda distribution in conda focus on data science, whereas pip is for general use. Conda installs precompiled packages. For example, the Anaconda distribution comes with Numpy, Scipy, and Scikit-learn compiled with the MKL library, speeding up various math operations. But, sometimes, you may need packages other than the ones listed on the Anaconda distribution.\n",
    "2. Pip can install both Python and non-Python packages. Pip can install any package listed on the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.org) (PyPI).\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-info\">\n",
    "You can (and will) still use pip alongside conda to install packages.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Environments\n",
    "A Python environment comprises a particular version of each of the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Python interpreter,\n",
    "* Python-packages, and\n",
    "* The utility scripts, such as pip.\n",
    "\n",
    "> It is possible to have two or more environments residing on the same computer virtually. If you are using Anaconda, you are in the ```base(root)``` environment by-default. \n",
    "<br/>\n",

    "\n",
    "<br/>\n",
    "<br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Along with managing packages, Conda is also a virtual environment manager. It's similar to [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/) and [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv), other popular environment managers.\n",
    "<br/>\n",
    "<br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why do you need a Virtual Environment?** \\\n",
    "Each virtual environment remains isolated from other virtual environments, and the default “system” environment. **Environments allow you to separate and isolate the packages you are using for different projects**. Often you’ll be working with code that depends on different versions of some library. For example, you could have code that uses new features in Numpy, or code that uses old features that have been removed. It’s practically impossible to have two versions of Numpy installed at once, as having both installed can lead to a lot of confusion and bugs. Instead, you should make an environment for each version of Numpy then work in the appropriate environment for the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<br/>\n",
    "You can also export the list of packages in an environment to a file, then include that file with your code. This allows other people to easily load all the dependencies for your code. Pip has similar functionality with:\n",
