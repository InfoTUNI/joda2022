      "{'text': \"I bought this phone back when I had AT&T's pre-paid plan. I was tired of having a 'cheap' phone that always broke and had no features. I was not into smart phones or having the 'latest and greatest' phone, I just wanted something that worked and didn't look like it was from the 1800's. All my friends run out and buy the newest iPhones and Samsungs like it's the most important thing on the planet. When I take out this cheap phone, everyone is amazed at how fast and snappy the performance is, compared to their $600 iPhone. This phone now pushes the Windows 8.1 update as well.Pros:1. Swipe to text - I can't swipe to text almost as fast as I can type on a keyboard2. GPS - built in with free maps and map updates, threw my old GPS right in the trash, it's accurate and easy to use3. Wi-fi - I get speeds over 20 Mbps on my home router, I can browse the internet without using a data plan via wi-fi as fast as my home computer4. Camera - Only 5 megapixels, but shoots very good and surprisingly steady shots5. Ease of use - this phone is ridiculously intuitive. I find iOS and Android very annoying and 'dumbed down' for someone over the age of 3, all my features are easy to find and quickly customizable.6. Live tiles - again, you can easily customize your 'home screen' to look however you want it to, including transparent tiles with a background image (new to Win 8+)7. Micro SD slot - You can store your music, movies and now apps on your card, saving valuable internal storageCons:1. Battery life - After the Windows 8.1 update my battery life became awful. After a couple hours of heavy use it was almost dead. Come to find out, a lot of apps run in the background. Using the battery saver feature I identified those and restricted their usage. Battery life isn't where it was under Windows 7x, but better than after I first updated.2. Apps - There just aren't as many as there are for iOS and Android. The big ones are there (FB, major banks, etc.) but don't expect to find a lot of the smaller onesAll in all, I'm very pleased with this phone. Considering I didn't get it to enter the smart phone market, it certainly seems to be a winner. It seems very rugged and has stood up well to several drops on the pavement. Updates take forever, by the way, sometimes over an hour. Just be patient. I thought my phone was broken at first.\", 'rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars'}\n",

Obviously the problem relates to Microsoft being incapable of delivering a smart phone that works half as well as most Android devices. Back to the drawing board people.... or just discontinue this. I gave two stars because it works as a phone and WhatsApp works ok.Warning: Do not buy this if it is not being sold from Nokia. I made the mistake of doing this and got what I can only assume is an AT&T clone instead of a Nokia factory direct phone with the result the camera sucks.Where to begin with what is wrong... *sigh*Cons:1. Effectively no expandable storage...what you buy initially is what the phone will use for apps which is where most of your storage inflation comes from and Microsoft does not give you an option to store apps anywhere else so it's basically as if you have no expandable storage...sometimes I think it is still storing videos on the phone memory even though it is supposed to store photos and videos on the card since I installed a micro sd.2. After a while it will refuse to clear temp files...you have to do some kind of crazy fix - go into settings and set the year to 2100 and then you will suddenly have more space free...and yet it still will not clear completely.3. Windows store has precious little useful apps that are free4. No file explorer, seriously!! (Seriously, Microsoft-you did that?)5. Bing - an entire button dedicated to Bing...seriously? Guess what it is what everyone else is used to as the back button so for a while after getting this, I kept making the error and pressing the search engine when I really just wanted to go back.6. Speaking of going back...there does not seem to be that option in the only web browser that comes with this phone: Internet Explorer7. The only browser that comes with this is IE - major flaw...I like options....not restrictions...especially when the restriction is to something that is somewhat inferior to what the alternatives are.8.

That is a needlessly clunky operating system for a telephone and although we could cope as we had Windows 10 on our desktop, it is a PITA and thus I give it a 4-star rating. When booting the phone up, the process will attempt to force you into signing up for an AT&T plan, so you must carefully decline all those options in the initial start up phase. Then, however, you will have to sign up with some network to have the phone work. The phone has 1 micro-sized SIM card slot, and we cut down our standard sized SIM from an old phone to a micro size and successfully activated the phone with that card. So far no problems in the USA or in mainland Europe.

It does not have as many apps, or at least not the original but knockoff apps, as google or apple, but it's manageable.  After having it for a few months now, it is randomly powering off and I have to remove the battery and put it back in to turn it back on, so a bit irritating, but I can deal with it.  One thing I really don't like is the camera. First of all, it does not have a front camera, or at least mine doesn't. It has the place for one, but it isn't hooked up or something because my screen protector came with an opening over the spot that I can see could hold a front camera, but it has no option to use it.  and the back camera is fairly poor quality and also lacks a flash.  Big let down for me, a snapchatter and photo lover, but for some of you, it won't be that big of a deal. Windows also doesn't have snapchat as of now, but hopefully will soon.Pros:Windows 8 (if you like that)Office already on thereSome cool pre-installed apps and featuresGood design for a phoneCons:No front camera, crappy back camera, and no flashNo snapchat, pinterest,or gmail appRandomly shuts off and requires battery removal to power on againAll in all, it's not the best phone in the world, but for the price, it's worth it\", 'rating': '3.0 out of 5 stars'}\n",

I did this initially because it is required to download apps (which I later found out weren't compatible with my phone anyway). Once I had paired, I realized that the phone screwed up my phonebook contacts in my phone as well as on my email. I had to reset to factory settings to get the paired email address off, and then I still had to fix my contacts in my email. I'm aware that this functionality could be very useful, but it was something I didn't want. My experience since has been great.

      "{'text': \"I got this as my first smart phone and wisely followed the advice of some tech blogger not to blow your budget on your first smart phone because anything is an upgrade from whatever you had last (in my case a Motorola Razr, may it RIP).  I bought the phone largely based on its low price (about $150 back in 2013), long battery life, satisfied reviews about the phone and its relatives' durability and lasting functionality, and the offline GPS capability (I wanted to be able to use it as a GPS without consuming tons of data).  For all of these points, I am still very satisfied with my purchase.After 2.5 years, my Lumia has finally conked out on me with a screen that is extremely dark, so it can only be read with difficulty in a dark room.  It's fully functional in all other ways, but obviously it's time for me to search for a replacement.  The screen had begun developing a bit of a shadow over the past year, which had reached about half of the screen, but it was still usable- just a little dark.  That (which may have been due to occasional dropping) and the update issue are the only problems I've had.  About once a year, I had to wipe my phone clean because the updates download and install, but they don't erase the old updates and you can't manually do that, so the only solution is a factory reset.  That's a pain, but at least I found a way to extend my phone's life.  I allowed my contacts to sync with the cloud, so once I logged into the reset phone with my Microsoft account, it automatically began downloading everything and it wasn't such a nuisance.Even after 2.5 years, the battery still lasts a good waking day (12-16 hrs) with heavy use (web browsing, talking, music playing, texting).  Most of all, as I'm looking at changing types of phones, I'm going to miss not being connected to an umbilical cord every time I see a free plug in public.  The battery life on this phone truly is unmatched.  At 2.5 years old, my phone can still go for nearly 48 hours with very light use and if you use battery save mode.The camera is slow and not great, but I'd rather have a high quality camera that doesn't run a risk of falling in the toilet or meeting some other awful fate because it's a multi-hundred dollar piece that follows me everywhere on a daily basis.  I'm fine with carrying a separate camera on vacations to take proper photos and the basic camera this device has works well enough for sending funny, unimportant photos to friends.The one thing I missed was a front-facing cam.  I never thought I'd care about selfies until I got a smart phone.  Having an awkward back-facing cam helps you feel like more of a fool, though, and severely cuts down on the number of selfies, so it's not all bad.I would recommend this phone or newer generations as a great starting place for a budget smart phone.  They're functional and I would say durable.  I haven't stepped on my phone or anything- all it's suffered are drops while inside of a plastic case- but things have lasted pretty darn well for the price and the length of time that it has lasted me.\", 'rating': '4.0 out of 5 stars'}\n",

Plug in a local SIM and you get cheap calls, a local number and reasonably priced data plan.  I thought I'd try a Windows phone just to see what it was like.I just hated this.  Awkward and unintuitive IMO.  App store a joke.  Also, a bunch of AT&T infrastructure on the one I got, that was useless with the local SIM.  The phone felt cheap and the glass scratched easily.  Mine was unlocked, as advertised, though.The Windows tiles are terrible for a phone, IMO.  Might be fine for a PC or a large tablet but I'll never find out.  My last try with Microsoft.  There are just too many better options.\", 'rating': '2.0 out of 5 stars'}\n",

Also some new apps just showed up (like Microsoft solitaire) that completed stuff I was looking for. Nokia also has upgraded their suit of apps, and the new camera beta is really powerful. Hard to believe you get all this for such a good price. Did I mention the replaceable battery, or the microSD card slot for storing pictures, videos, and music? Even has an FM radio built in -- not an Internet one (which it can do too), but a real radio, which is just cool. Also saves on data streaming if there's a radio nearby you like to listen to. (BTW, I got an unlocked one because I don't use ATT and I travel to Asia a lot. It was just as advertised.

      "{'text': 'I bought this phone, not to use as a cellphone, but to use as a \"mini computer\" when traveling. I travel almost year-round, so I wanted to have a device that I could use when connected to Wifi for emails, Skype, Youtube, and things like that. Many hotels, even budget hotels in developing countries, now offer free WiFi for their guests to use.The phone has worked even better than I even hoped it would. Although it is the first smartphone I have owned(so I am not an expert) I really enjoy using Windows 8, and I couldn\\'t be more pleased with the quality of this Nokia smartphone. In regard to \"apps\" I find the amount of apps available at the present time to be most satisfactory. Every time someone has recommended an app(that they use on their Iphone or android phone) it has been available on my Windows phone. Bing News is fantastic when traveling. Having Microsoft Office built-in(available to use when not connected to Wifi) seems incredible. The GPS works great for traveling and(as far as I know) all the maps of the world are available from Nokia for free. The maps are all available right on the phone(need Wifi to download).The maps (and GPS) work offline(when not connected to WiFi). As far as emails(I use hotmail) I can write a new email, or reply to an email, even when I am offline. If I am offline the phone automatically puts the new completed emails into an \"outbox\" folder. The next time the phone is connected to Wifi all of the completed emails are automatically sent. While the emails are in the outbox folder waiting to be sent I can click on an email and edit it, if I want.I purchased an \"unlocked\" phone so that I would have the option to buy local prepaid telephone service if I ever am in a foreign country and wish to have temporary cellphone service.The only negative thing I can say about the phone(and I have the feeling this applies to smartphones in general) is the fact that the smartphone must be charged nearly everyday. To compensate for that I purchased an extra Nokia battery(for about $7 from Amazon) that I carry with me when I am traveling. It is identical to the original batter that came with the phone.The bottom line is that I couldn\\'t be happier than I am with the Nokia Lumia 520 smartphone.', 'rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars'}\n",

      "{'text': \"I purchased this smartphone as a backup when I recently ordered an Unlocked  Motorola Razr MAXX HD as my primary phone but received a Razr HD instead.  I needed an inexpensive backup phone during my wait for my MAXX HD to arrive in the mail, but was impressed at how nice a phone this Unlocked Quad-Band Nokia 520 really is.  I use Simple Mobile cell service and needed a phone that used their frequencies 1700/2100.  Note:  Simple Mobile uses the T-Mobile network at discount prices.  Some information for this phone states that it's only a 3G phone, but I'm getting 4G service with no problem.  Web pages load quickly; call quality is excellent; battery life is much better than my Motorola.  I like that this phone has Windows 8.0 OS installed on it - Android updates can be a pain sometimes.  Overall, this entry level phone has exceeded my expectations and I like the size since it fits nicely in my front pocket.  The only problem that I must report on is more of a design flaw  - the power button, that's also used to wake up the phone, is located on the right side of the phone and easily pressed by accident.  The power button should be on top instead.  Would definitely recommend this smartphone for anyone looking for an inexpensive entry level phone that thinks it's a higher end model.\", 'rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars'}\n",

Phone is nice and easy to setup.I used Free Amazon Prime trial for shipping and it was supposed to reach me next day but it was delayed for another day.

The letters showed up as I tried typing but they wouldn't appear in the text that I was trying to send. I don't use this for anything beyond text, calls, a few pictures, and very seldomly checking emails, so the phone didn't have a lot of things stored, app usage, etc.  I treat my phones well with protective screens and phone covers, so they aren't tossed about.

Also some new apps just showed up (like Microsoft solitaire) that completed stuff I was looking for. Nokia also has upgraded their suit of apps, and the new camera beta is really powerful. Hard to believe you get all this for such a good price. Did I mention the replaceable battery, or the microSD card slot for storing pictures, videos, and music? Even has an FM radio built in -- not an Internet one (which it can do too), but a real radio, which is just cool. Also saves on data streaming if there's a radio nearby you like to listen to.

      "{'text': '[Updated Dec 2014 after 1 year]I got an unlocked Nokia 520 (4-band GSM, int\\'l) for $150 from Hasslefree Cell via Amazon. It arrived quickly and in perfect condition. I installed a TMobile prepaid SIM card. I\\'ve bought a few apps from the MS App Store and have learned some things that may help others now, so I\\'ll discuss them briefly.I wanted a basic phone with media player capabilities, at low cost. I have all \"connectedness\" turned off and so can\\'t comment on the Facebook etc apps, nor on the maps and GPS. I have WiFi \\'on\\' only when I\\'m downloading apps. I put in a 32GB SD card because I wasn\\'t sure how well it all would work; in retrospect 64GB would be justified.  The phone came with Windows Phone 8 which subsequently upgraded easily to WP 8.1,I originally bought YXPlayer to watch videos, but it had issues and stopped working completely with WP 8.1.  So I switched to Moliplayer Pro which seems fine.  The 520\\'s bundled music player will play MP3s directly, but still without a dragbar, and space on the phone is limited. If you use that app you\\'ll want to properly tag the files (Artist, Album, Track Name) so the player can sort them out.I bought Fiction Book Reader which handles .MOBI and .EPUB books just fine. To use it, first put the book files on the root (not in a subfolder) of the SD card. Then use the down-arrow button within FBR to import the file into FBR\\'s workspace in the phone\\'s memory.I was worried that the 4\" screen might be too small for films or even books, but it\\'s just big enough.  A 4.3\" phone would be better, but this is pretty cool: personal theater in the palm of your hand. Perfect for travel, especially with the ability to use a local SIM card in almost any country.Most reviews of the 520 oddly omit the MS Office (Word, Excel, and Powerpoint) tools that come with the phone! With these you can view existing documents and make text and spreadsheet cell value changes. I find this amazing on such a tiny device. Windows Phone 8.1 seems to have added the ability to read and write these docs to the SD card, which is great, plus they can be retrieved from SkyDrive.The WP8.1 upgrade added the \"Cortana\" voice-recognition app.  This relies on the internet for almost everything, and is generally useless to me personally since I don\\'t maintain connectivity.  Because my phone was evidently redirected from the Malaysian market I had to change a few settings for Cortana to appear in the apps list.  Key among these were to have the region set to US; to have US (not UK) English at the top of the language list; and have US keyboard at the top of its list.I wanted Cortana enabled because it includes \"Quiet Time\" which at last lets me specify the only phone numbers that I want to get calls from.  To do this, create each of your special numbers as a Contact; then select them individually to create an \"Inner Circle\" group.  I set Quiet Hours to \"On\" with schedule \"Everyday\" and active from 10AM - 10AM i.e. 24/7.  I enabled the options to let my Inner Circle break through, along with anyone who calls twice in three minutes.  Finally... spam phone calls are stopped.  They would still go to voice mail but I turned that off too, pending a fatal virus that affects only telemarketers.Why a simple whitelist isn\\'t native to Windows Phone 8 is beyond me, but at least I have it now.WP8.1 also added the ability (or I missed it earlier) of installing or moving apps from the internal storage to the microSD card.  With a 64GB chip your pocket device can have hundreds of TV shows, audiobooks, ebooks, apps, pictures etc.Overall the Nokia 520 represents amazing value; probably unbeatable if your needs are like mine. Especially since the price has now (Dec 2014) dropped to $80!  I love it.', 'rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars'}\n",

You can buy one for $70.It has 4G, for that price that is good.The touchscreen works very well.The display screen is not bad.The sound is good but that just might be tmobile (i had sprint before which is NOT recommended as a) their reception is horrible and b) they have CDMA phones which you cannot take to another carrier, you are stuck with them). Update-the sound is good on Nokia (and it is not tmobile). Nokia has a good reputation in other Asian countries, the sound is quite good.ConsIt is a windows phone, so goodbye to anything else that you are used to. You cannot download any browser, so goodbye Chrome, Firefox, Opera or the like. You can only use IE and who wants to use that!For any search, you have to use Bing.There is no swipe for keyboard.The annoying tiles you see are there to stay. And worse, you have even more smaller annoying tiles inside them which keep flipping like mad-at first I thought I could upload my contacts pics to that, that would at least make it interesting. but no. No updating, those flipping tiles are there to stay (you can remove some of them but you cannot modify them)The camera is terrible.There are very LIMITED apps. Period.Settings-you cannot change the main screen with an image you like, the tiles are all you get. The lock screen image can be changed.The Phone function is really badly displayed. Your contacts are not easily detectable, you have to do some detective work, run arounds and then you land on a \"People\" screen. Seriously, that is such a run around just to get to your contacts.If this phone had the same or at least a similar UI to Samsung (just the Call aspect) it would be worth looking into. It is very easy to see why these Windows phone are lagging in the market. By restricting users to Microsoft products they have already lost the race in other departments, this is just another example of the same.If you just need something while you are waiting for the next thing, great.

      "{'text': \"This review refers to the specific phone and not to any issuing company. Although the pluses of this model are many with no need to repeat them here as they have been well listed by other reviewers, my beef is just one: Microsoft. The Nokia uses Microsoft system and this has been a negative experience, so much so that I will sell or get rid of the Nokia and get an iPhone. My main area of dissatisfaction, among others, is with the phone book - there seems to be nine. Every time I wish to enter a friend and their phone number I am forced to choose either to upload these to google or Microsoft. In many operations, the opine tries to force you to have an account with Microsoft. You cannot get beyond this step while entering a phone number. So I have chosen google, though I am reluctant to store on google's servers friends phone numbers who might not wish to have them there. But then e synching with google suddenly stopped working, with no time-wasting attempts seeming to work. Checking forums, I came across literally hundreds of people facing the same issue- synching to google suddenly stopping and therefore loosing all contact information, the names of callers disappearing, etc. and no attempt to re synch working, and of course no explanation on how to fix it. Seemingly, starting the supposedly for our convenience google two step verification process seems to fix it, people found out through trial and error, but I do mot wish to lock myself into this system. So, it seems like once again Microsoft screws up a good thing (Nokia). I know that Apple is no better in terms of its insidious forcing people to accept certain conditions, but if I can at least have a phone book under my control, I will reluctantly make the switch. Other people may not encounter this issue or even have a problem with it, but I raise it only to make people aware that only because of it's operating system, governed by Microsoft, that this phone might lead to problems.\", 'rating': '2.0 out of 5 stars'}\n",

UNLOCKED means \"no contract\" and you can put YOUR OWN SIM in.  I fear that many of the so-called \"unlocked phones\" on amazon are limited to a specific network.And NEVER buy anything from MICROSOFT; the service is dreadful and the so-called technical \"help\" is staffed by people who do not know what they are doing.H', 'rating': '1.0 out of 5 stars'}\n",
