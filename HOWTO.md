## Create a new course instance

As forking a repository is not an option here, a new course instance is created by [duplicating a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/duplicating-a-repository).

*In fact, it seems that [forking ones own repository](https://deanmalone.net/post/how-to-fork-your-own-repo-on-github/
) is doable, however it insists using the command line.

To complete the previous, you may need to create a [Personal Access Token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token). 

After you have succesfully copied the repository, enable the repository under Github Pages: select <kbd>Branch:master</kbd> under <kbd>Source</kbd>.
